I am currently a Postdoc Fellow at Yale University with an interest in contributing to a deeper understanding of individuals and firms decision-making, the diffusion of platforms, and data science.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from New York University in September 2019. My research interests are in Industrial Organization, Competition Policy, Statistical and Reinforcement Learning, and Applied Microeconomics.

I employ theory, numerical methods, and econometrics to better understand the inter-relationships among consumers and firms under imperfect environments and their decision process under imperfect information. Although all my current projects are theoretically founded, they study real cases.
