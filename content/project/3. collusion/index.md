title: "3. Market Structure, Loss-leading and the Hub-and-spoke Collusion"
summary: "This article examines the incentives loss-leading strategy generates on retailers and manufacturers to collude using a hub-and-spoke scheme. In the model, loss-leading arises due to the existence of a positive complementarity between demands. To allow the possibility of a hub-and-spoke type of agreement, the model assumes that the upstream firm and retailers negotiate the wholesale price via a Nash Bargaining process. Results suggest the manufacturer and both retailers collude to impose a minimum resale price when the degree of complementarity between demands is high and when the degree of inter-brand competition in the core product belongs to an intermediate value."
