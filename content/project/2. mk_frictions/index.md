title: "2. Policies Reducing Network Externalities and Switching Costs: An Application to the Mobile Phone Market"
summary: "This article develops a dynamic model of duopolistic price competition to assess the impact of network externalities and switching costs on prices and entry. Results suggest that firms with higher market shares set higher prices when market frictions are relevant: the large firm exploits the locked-in phenomenon. Market frictions also make the entry and growth of small firms harder: their expected demand and value function are lower even when they set competitive prices. The latter effects are stronger when the market matures. Lastly, the model is tested fitting prices in the Chilean mobile phone market before and after the implementation of the MNP and the elimination of the tariff differentiation between on-net and off-net calls."
