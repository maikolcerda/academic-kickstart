title: "1. The evolution of platform use and platform revenue: The case of Facebook."
summary: "I investigate the effects of direct and indirect network effects on diffusion and the innovator's profits. The main result is the innovation diffuses faster, users pay lower prices and the platform earns higher profits when it faces a two-sided market. The platform wants to obtain a relevant number of adopters to earn profits from advertisers. Numerical solutions establish that the diffusion process is S-shaped when the utility of advertisers grows faster than the users'. Lastly, the model is tested fitting Facebook's historical data. The model closely replicates the evolution of active users and the profits Facebook has earned due to advertising."
